"The SQLAlchemy SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper is a "
"comprehensive set of tools for working with databases and Python. It has "
"several distinct areas of functionality which can be used individually or"
" combined together. Its major components are illustrated below, with "
"component dependencies organized into layers:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:17
msgid ""
"Above, the two most significant front-facing portions of SQLAlchemy are "
"the **Object Relational Mapper** and the **SQL Expression Language**. SQL"
" Expressions can be used independently of the ORM. When using the ORM, "
"the SQL Expression language remains part of the public facing API as it "
"is used within object-relational configurations and queries."

msgid "Documentation Overview"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:30
msgid ""
"The documentation is separated into three sections: :ref:`orm_toplevel`, "
":ref:`core_toplevel`, and :ref:`dialect_toplevel`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:33
msgid ""
"In :ref:`orm_toplevel`, the Object Relational Mapper is introduced and "
"fully described. New users should begin with the "
":ref:`ormtutorial_toplevel`. If you want to work with higher-level SQL "
"which is constructed automatically for you, as well as management of "
"Python objects, proceed to this tutorial."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:38
msgid ""
"In :ref:`core_toplevel`, the breadth of SQLAlchemy's SQL and database "
"integration and description services are documented, the core of which is"
" the SQL Expression language. The SQL Expression Language is a toolkit "
"all its own, independent of the ORM package, which can be used to "
"construct manipulable SQL expressions which can be programmatically "
"constructed, modified, and executed, returning cursor-like result sets. "
"In contrast to the ORM's domain-centric mode of usage, the expression "
"language provides a schema-centric usage paradigm. New users should begin"
" here with :ref:`sqlexpression_toplevel`. SQLAlchemy engine, connection, "
"and pooling services are also described in :ref:`core_toplevel`."

"In :ref:`dialect_toplevel`, reference documentation for all provided "

msgid "Supported Installation Methods"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:90
msgid ""
"SQLAlchemy installation is via standard Python methodologies that are "
"based on `setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/>`_, either "
"by referring to ``setup.py`` directly or by using `pip "
"<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/>`_ or other setuptools-compatible "
"approaches."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:96
msgid ""
"setuptools is now required by the setup.py file; plain distutils installs"
" are no longer supported."

msgid "Install via pip"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:102
msgid ""
"When ``pip`` is available, the distribution can be downloaded from Pypi "
"and installed in one step::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:107
msgid ""
"This command will download the latest **released** version of SQLAlchemy "
"from the `Python Cheese Shop <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SQLAlchemy>`_ "
"and install it to your system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:110
msgid ""
"In order to install the latest **prerelease** version, such as "

msgid "Installing the C Extensions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:131
msgid ""
"SQLAlchemy includes C extensions which provide an extra speed boost for "
"dealing with result sets.   The extensions are supported on both the 2.xx"
" and 3.xx series of cPython."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:135
msgid ""
"``setup.py`` will automatically build the extensions if an appropriate "
"platform is detected. If the build of the C extensions fails due to a "
"missing compiler or other issue, the setup process will output a warning "
"message and re-run the build without the C extensions upon completion, "
"reporting final status."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:140
msgid ""
"To run the build/install without even attempting to compile the C "
"extensions, the ``DISABLE_SQLALCHEMY_CEXT`` environment variable may be "
"specified.  The use case for this is either for special testing "
"circumstances, or in the rare case of compatibility/build issues not "
"overcome by the usual \"rebuild\" mechanism::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../intro.rst:148
msgid ""
"The legacy ``--without-cextensions`` flag has been removed from the "

"SQLAlchemy is designed to operate with a :term:`DBAPI` implementation "

"popular databases. The individual database sections in "
":doc:`/dialects/index` enumerate the available DBAPIs for each database, "
