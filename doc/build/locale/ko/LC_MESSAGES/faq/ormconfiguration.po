"The SQLAlchemy ORM, in order to map to a particular table, needs there to"
" be at least one column denoted as a primary key column; multiple-column,"
" i.e. composite, primary keys are of course entirely feasible as well.  "
"These columns do **not** need to be actually known to the database as "
"primary key columns, though it's a good idea that they are.  It's only "
"necessary that the columns *behave* as a primary key does, e.g. as a "
"unique and not nullable identifier for a row."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:22
msgid ""
"Most ORMs require that objects have some kind of primary key defined "
"because the object in memory must correspond to a uniquely identifiable "
"row in the database table; at the very least, this allows the object can "
"be targeted for UPDATE and DELETE statements which will affect only that "
"object's row and no other.   However, the importance of the primary key "
"goes far beyond that.  In SQLAlchemy, all ORM-mapped objects are at all "
"times linked uniquely within a :class:`.Session` to their specific "
"database row using a pattern called the :term:`identity map`, a pattern "
"that's central to the unit of work system employed by SQLAlchemy, and is "
"also key to the most common (and not-so-common) patterns of ORM usage."

"It's important to note that we're only talking about the SQLAlchemy ORM; "
"an application which builds on Core and deals only with :class:`.Table` "
"objects, :func:`.select` constructs and the like, **does not** need any "
"primary key to be present on or associated with a table in any way "
"(though again, in SQL, all tables should really have some kind of primary"
" key, lest you need to actually update or delete specific rows)."

"In almost all cases, a table does have a so-called :term:`candidate key`,"
" which is a column or series of columns that uniquely identify a row.  If"

"the table is not corresponding to `first normal form "
"<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_normal_form>`_ and cannot be mapped."

"This condition refers to when a mapping contains two columns that are "

"explicit names for every attribute that is to store an independent value;"

"This behavior is often desirable and is allowed without warning in the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:240
msgid ""
"A relational database can return rows in any arbitrary order, when an "
"explicit ordering is not set. While this ordering very often corresponds "
"to the natural order of rows within a table, this is not the case for all"
" databases and all queries.   The consequence of this is that any query "
"that limits rows using ``LIMIT`` or ``OFFSET`` should **always** specify "
"an ``ORDER BY``. Otherwise, it is not deterministic which rows will "
"actually be returned."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:248
msgid ""
"When we use a SQLAlchemy method like :meth:`.Query.first`, we are in fact"
" applying a ``LIMIT`` of one to the query, so without an explicit "
"ordering it is not deterministic what row we actually get back. While we "
"may not notice this for simple queries on databases that usually returns "
"rows in their natural order, it becomes much more of an issue if we also "
"use :func:`.orm.subqueryload` to load related collections, and we may not"
" be loading the collections as intended."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:257
msgid ""
"SQLAlchemy implements :func:`.orm.subqueryload` by issuing a separate "
"query, the results of which are matched up to the results from the first "
"query. We see two queries emitted like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:276
msgid ""
"The second query embeds the first query as a source of rows. When the "
"inner query uses ``OFFSET`` and/or ``LIMIT`` without ordering, the two "
"queries may not see the same results:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:296

"Depending on database specifics, there is a chance we may get a result "
"like the following for the two queries::"

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:315
msgid ""
"Above, we receive two ``addresses`` rows for ``user.id`` of 2, and none "
"for 1.  We've wasted two rows and failed to actually load the collection."
"  This is an insidious error because without looking at the SQL and the "
"results, the ORM will not show that there's any issue; if we access the "
"``addresses`` for the ``User`` we have, it will emit a lazy load for the "
"collection and we won't see that anything actually went wrong."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:322
msgid ""
"The solution to this problem is to always specify a deterministic sort "
"order, so that the main query always returns the same set of rows. This "
"generally means that you should :meth:`.Query.order_by` on a unique "
"column on the table. The primary key is a good choice for this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/ormconfiguration.rst:329
msgid ""
"Note that the :func:`.joinedload` eager loader strategy does not suffer "
"from the same problem because only one query is ever issued, so the load "
"query cannot be different from the main query.  Similarly, the "
":func:`.selectinload` eager loader strategy also does not have this issue"
" as it links its collection loads directly to primary key values just "
"loaded."
