":class:`.Table` and :class:`.Column` are not good targets for direct "
"subclassing. However, there are simple ways to get on-construction "
"behaviors using creation functions, and behaviors related to the linkages"
" between schema objects such as constraint conventions or naming "
"conventions using attachment events. An example of many of these "
"techniques can be seen at `Naming Conventions "
