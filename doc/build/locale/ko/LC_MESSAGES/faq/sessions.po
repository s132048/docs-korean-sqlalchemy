"The main issue regarding this behavior is that the session acts as though"

"In short, serializable isolation level generally means that once you "

"operations which, once failed, the transaction is not allowed to "
"continue::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/sessions.rst:165
msgid ""
"What SQLAlchemy offers that solves both issues is support of SAVEPOINT, "
"via :meth:`.Session.begin_nested`. Using :meth:`.Session.begin_nested`, "

"This is again a matter of the :class:`.Session` providing a consistent "

" levels. Such as, suppose you had a decorator ``@with_session()``, which "
"did this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/sessions.rst:190
msgid ""
"The above decorator begins a transaction if one does not exist already, "
"and then commits it, if it were the creator. The \"subtransactions\" flag"
" means that if :meth:`.Session.begin` were already called by an enclosing"
" function, nothing happens except a counter is incremented - this counter"
" is decremented when :meth:`.Session.commit` is called and only when it "
"goes back to zero does the actual COMMIT happen. It allows this usage "
"pattern::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/sessions.rst:211
msgid ""
"``one()`` can call ``two()``, or ``two()`` can be called by itself, and "
"the ``@with_session`` decorator ensures the appropriate \"framing\" - the"
" transaction boundaries stay on the outermost call level. As you can see,"
" if ``two()`` calls ``flush()`` which throws an exception and then issues"
" a ``rollback()``, there will *always* be a second ``rollback()`` "
"performed by the decorator, and possibly a third corresponding to two "
"levels of decorator. If the ``flush()`` pushed the ``rollback()`` all the"
" way out to the top of the stack, and then we said that all remaining "
"``rollback()`` calls are moot, there is some silent behavior going on "
"there. A poorly written enclosing method might suppress the exception, "
"and then call ``commit()`` assuming nothing is wrong, and then you have a"
" silent failure condition. The main reason people get this error in fact "
"is because they didn't write clean \"framing\" code and they would have "
"had other problems down the road."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/sessions.rst:225
msgid ""
"If you think the above use case is a little exotic, the same kind of "
"thing comes into play if you want to SAVEPOINT- you might call "
"``begin_nested()`` several times, and the ``commit()``/``rollback()`` "
"calls each resolve the most recent ``begin_nested()``. The meaning of "
"``rollback()`` or ``commit()`` is dependent upon which enclosing block it"
" is called, and you might have any sequence of "
"``rollback()``/``commit()`` in any order, and its the level of nesting "
"that determines their behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/sessions.rst:233
msgid ""
"In both of the above cases, if ``flush()`` broke the nesting of "
"transaction blocks, the behavior is, depending on scenario, anywhere from"
" \"magic\" to silent failure to blatant interruption of code flow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq/sessions.rst:237
msgid ""
"``flush()`` makes its own \"subtransaction\", so that a transaction is "
"started up regardless of the external transactional state, and when "
"complete it calls ``commit()``, or ``rollback()`` upon failure - but that"
" ``rollback()`` corresponds to its own subtransaction - it doesn't want "
"to guess how you'd like to handle the external \"framing\" of the "
"transaction, which could be nested many levels with any combination of "
"subtransactions and real SAVEPOINTs. The job of starting/ending the "
"\"frame\" is kept consistently with the code external to the ``flush()``,"
