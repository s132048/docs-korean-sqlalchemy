"The default behavior of :func:`.relationship` is to fully load the "
"collection of items in, as according to the loading strategy of the "
"relationship. Additionally, the :class:`.Session` by default only knows "
"how to delete objects which are actually present within the session. When"
" a parent instance is marked for deletion and flushed, the "
":class:`.Session` loads its full list of child items in so that they may "
"either be deleted as well, or have their foreign key value set to null; "
"this is to avoid constraint violations. For large collections of child "
"items, there are several strategies to bypass full loading of child items"
