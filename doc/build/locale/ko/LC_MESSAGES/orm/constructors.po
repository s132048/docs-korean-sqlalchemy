"Mapping imposes no restrictions or requirements on the constructor "
"(``__init__``) method for the class. You are free to require any "
"arguments for the function that you wish, assign attributes to the "
"instance that are unknown to the ORM, and generally do anything else you "
"would normally do when writing a constructor for a Python class."

"The SQLAlchemy ORM does not call ``__init__`` when recreating objects "
"from database rows. The ORM's process is somewhat akin to the Python "
"standard library's ``pickle`` module, invoking the low level ``__new__`` "
"method and then quietly restoring attributes directly on the instance "
"rather than calling ``__init__``."

"If you need to do some setup on database-loaded instances before they're "
"ready to use, there is an event hook known as "
":meth:`.InstanceEvents.load` which can achieve this; it is also available"
" via a class-specific decorator called :func:`.orm.reconstructor`.   When"
" using :func:`.orm.reconstructor`, the mapper will invoke the decorated "
"method with no arguments every time it loads or reconstructs an instance "
"of the class. This is useful for recreating transient properties that are"
" normally assigned in ``__init__``::"

"Above, when ``obj = MyMappedClass()`` is executed, the ``__init__`` "
"constructor is invoked normally and the ``data`` argument is required.  "
"When instances are loaded during a :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query` "
"operation as in ``query(MyMappedClass).one()``, ``init_on_load`` is "
"called."

"Any method may be tagged as the :func:`.orm.reconstructor`, even the "
"``__init__`` method itself.    It is invoked after all immediate column-"
"level attributes are loaded as well as after eagerly-loaded scalar "
"relationships.  Eagerly loaded collections may be only partially "
"populated or not populated at all, depending on the kind of eager loading"
" used."
