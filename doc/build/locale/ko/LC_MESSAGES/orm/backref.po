"The :paramref:`~.relationship.backref` keyword argument was first "
"introduced in :ref:`ormtutorial_toplevel`, and has been mentioned "
"throughout many of the examples here.   What does it actually do ?   "
"Let's start with the canonical ``User`` and ``Address`` scenario::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:29
msgid ""
"The above configuration establishes a collection of ``Address`` objects "
"on ``User`` called ``User.addresses``.   It also establishes a ``.user`` "
"attribute on ``Address`` which will refer to the parent ``User`` object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:33
msgid ""
"In fact, the :paramref:`~.relationship.backref` keyword is only a common "
"shortcut for placing a second :func:`.relationship` onto the ``Address`` "
"mapping, including the establishment of an event listener on both sides "
"which will mirror attribute operations in both directions.   The above "
"configuration is equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:59
msgid ""
"Above, we add a ``.user`` relationship to ``Address`` explicitly.  On "
"both relationships, the :paramref:`~.relationship.back_populates` "
"directive tells each relationship about the other one, indicating that "
"they should establish \"bidirectional\" behavior between each other.   "
"The primary effect of this configuration is that the relationship adds "
"event handlers to both attributes which have the behavior of \"when an "
"append or set event occurs here, set ourselves onto the incoming "
"attribute using this particular attribute name\". The behavior is "
"illustrated as follows.   Start with a ``User`` and an ``Address`` "
"instance.  The ``.addresses`` collection is empty, and the ``.user`` "
"attribute is ``None``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:77
msgid ""
"However, once the ``Address`` is appended to the ``u1.addresses`` "
"collection, both the collection and the scalar attribute have been "
"populated::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:86
msgid ""
"This behavior of course works in reverse for removal operations as well, "
"as well as for equivalent operations on both sides.   Such as when "
"``.user`` is set again to ``None``, the ``Address`` object is removed "
"from the reverse collection::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:95
msgid ""
"The manipulation of the ``.addresses`` collection and the ``.user`` "
"attribute occurs entirely in Python without any interaction with the SQL "
"database. Without this behavior, the proper state would be apparent on "
"both sides once the data has been flushed to the database, and later "
"reloaded after a commit or expiration operation occurs.  The "
":paramref:`~.relationship.backref`/:paramref:`~.relationship.back_populates`"
" behavior has the advantage that common bidirectional operations can "
"reflect the correct state without requiring a database round trip."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:103
msgid ""
"Remember, when the :paramref:`~.relationship.backref` keyword is used on "
"a single relationship, it's exactly the same as if the above two "
"relationships were created individually using "
":paramref:`~.relationship.back_populates` on each."

msgid ""
"We've established that the :paramref:`~.relationship.backref` keyword is "
"merely a shortcut for building two individual :func:`.relationship` "
"constructs that refer to each other.  Part of the behavior of this "
"shortcut is that certain configurational arguments applied to the "
":func:`.relationship` will also be applied to the other direction - "
"namely those arguments that describe the relationship at a schema level, "
"and are unlikely to be different in the reverse direction.  The usual "
"case here is a many-to-many :func:`.relationship` that has a "
":paramref:`~.relationship.secondary` argument, or a one-to-many or many-"
"to-one which has a :paramref:`~.relationship.primaryjoin` argument (the "
":paramref:`~.relationship.primaryjoin` argument is discussed in "
":ref:`relationship_primaryjoin`).  Such as if we limited the list of "
"``Address`` objects to those which start with \"tony\"::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:144
msgid ""
"We can observe, by inspecting the resulting property, that both sides of "
"the relationship have this join condition applied::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:154
msgid ""
"This reuse of arguments should pretty much do the \"right thing\" - it "
"uses only arguments that are applicable, and in the case of a many-to- "
"many relationship, will reverse the usage of "
":paramref:`~.relationship.primaryjoin` and "
":paramref:`~.relationship.secondaryjoin` to correspond to the other "
"direction (see the example in :ref:`self_referential_many_to_many` for "
"this)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:162
msgid ""
"It's very often the case however that we'd like to specify arguments that"
" are specific to just the side where we happened to place the "
"\"backref\". This includes :func:`.relationship` arguments like "
":paramref:`~.relationship.lazy`, :paramref:`~.relationship.remote_side`, "
":paramref:`~.relationship.cascade` and "
":paramref:`~.relationship.cascade_backrefs`.   For this case we use the "
":func:`.backref` function in place of a string::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:182
msgid ""
"Where above, we placed a ``lazy=\"joined\"`` directive only on the "
"``Address.user`` side, indicating that when a query against ``Address`` "
"is made, a join to the ``User`` entity should be made automatically which"
" will populate the ``.user`` attribute of each returned ``Address``.   "
"The :func:`.backref` function formatted the arguments we gave it into a "
"form that is interpreted by the receiving :func:`.relationship` as "
"additional arguments to be applied to the new relationship it creates."

msgid "One Way Backrefs"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:192
msgid ""
"An unusual case is that of the \"one way backref\".   This is where the "
"\"back-populating\" behavior of the backref is only desirable in one "
"direction. An example of this is a collection which contains a filtering "
":paramref:`~.relationship.primaryjoin` condition.   We'd like to append "
"items to this collection as needed, and have them populate the \"parent\""
" object on the incoming object. However, we'd also like to have items "
"that are not part of the collection, but still have the same \"parent\" "
"association - these items should never be in the collection."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:202
msgid ""
"Taking our previous example, where we established a "
":paramref:`~.relationship.primaryjoin` that limited the collection only "
"to ``Address`` objects whose email address started with the word "
"``tony``, the usual backref behavior is that all items populate in both "
"directions.   We wouldn't want this behavior for a case like the "
"following::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:215
msgid ""
"Above, the ``Address`` object that doesn't match the criterion of "
"\"starts with 'tony'\" is present in the ``addresses`` collection of "
"``u1``.   After these objects are flushed, the transaction committed and "
"their attributes expired for a re-load, the ``addresses`` collection will"
" hit the database on next access and no longer have this ``Address`` "
"object present, due to the filtering condition.   But we can do away with"
" this unwanted side of the \"backref\" behavior on the Python side by "
"using two separate :func:`.relationship` constructs, placing "
":paramref:`~.relationship.back_populates` only on one side::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:245
msgid ""
"With the above scenario, appending an ``Address`` object to the "
"``.addresses`` collection of a ``User`` will always establish the "
"``.user`` attribute on that ``Address``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:255
msgid ""
"However, applying a ``User`` to the ``.user`` attribute of an "
"``Address``, will not append the ``Address`` object to the collection::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/backref.rst:263
msgid ""
"Of course, we've disabled some of the usefulness of "
":paramref:`~.relationship.backref` here, in that when we do append an "
"``Address`` that corresponds to the criteria of "
"``email.startswith('tony')``, it won't show up in the ``User.addresses`` "
"collection until the session is flushed, and the attributes reloaded "
"after a commit or expire operation.   While we could consider an "
"attribute event that checks this criterion in Python, this starts to "
"cross the line of duplicating too much SQL behavior in Python.  The "
"backref behavior itself is only a slight transgression of this philosophy"
" - SQLAlchemy tries to keep these to a minimum overall."
