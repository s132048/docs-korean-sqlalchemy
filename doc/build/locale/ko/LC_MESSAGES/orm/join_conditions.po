"The custom criteria we use in a :paramref:`~.relationship.primaryjoin` is"

":meth:`.Query.join`, or via the eager \"joined\" or \"subquery\" styles "

"any ``Address`` object we'd like into the ``boston_addresses`` "
"collection, regardless of what the value of the ``.city`` attribute is."
"   The objects will remain present in the collection until the attribute "
"is expired and re-loaded from the database where the criterion is "

"``boston_addresses`` will be flushed unconditionally, assigning value of "
"the primary key ``user.id`` column onto the foreign-key-holding "
"``address.user_id`` column for each row.  The ``city`` criteria has no "
