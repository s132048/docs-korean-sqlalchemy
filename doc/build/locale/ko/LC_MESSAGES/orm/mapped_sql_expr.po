"The easiest and most flexible way to link relatively simple SQL "
"expressions to a class is to use a so-called \"hybrid attribute\", "
"described in the section :ref:`hybrids_toplevel`.  The hybrid provides "
"for an expression that works at both the Python level as well as at the "
"SQL expression level.  For example, below we map a class ``User``, "
"containing attributes ``firstname`` and ``lastname``, and include a "
"hybrid that will provide for us the ``fullname``, which is the string "
"concatenation of the two::"

"Above, the ``fullname`` attribute is interpreted at both the instance and"

"The string concatenation example is a simple one, where the Python "
"expression can be dual purposed at the instance and class level.  Often, "
"the SQL expression must be distinguished from the Python expression, "
"which can be achieved using :meth:`.hybrid_property.expression`.  Below "
"we illustrate the case where a conditional needs to be present inside the"
" hybrid, using the ``if`` statement in Python and the "
":func:`.sql.expression.case` construct for SQL expressions::"

msgid "Using column_property"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_sql_expr.rst:78
msgid ""
"The :func:`.orm.column_property` function can be used to map a SQL "
"expression in a manner similar to a regularly mapped :class:`.Column`. "
"With this technique, the attribute is loaded along with all other column-"
"mapped attributes at load time.  This is in some cases an advantage over "
"the usage of hybrids, as the value can be loaded up front at the same "
"time as the parent row of the object, particularly if the expression is "
"one which links to other tables (typically as a correlated subquery) to "
"access data that wouldn't normally be available on an already loaded "
"object."

msgid ""
"Disadvantages to using :func:`.orm.column_property` for SQL expressions "
"include that the expression must be compatible with the SELECT statement "
"emitted for the class as a whole, and there are also some configurational"
" quirks which can occur when using :func:`.orm.column_property` from "
"declarative mixins."

"Correlated subqueries may be used as well.  Below we use the "
":func:`.select` construct to create a SELECT that links together the "
"count of ``Address`` objects available for a particular ``User``::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_sql_expr.rst:131
msgid ""
"In the above example, we define a :func:`.select` construct like the "
"following::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_sql_expr.rst:137
msgid ""
"The meaning of the above statement is, select the count of ``Address.id``"
" rows where the ``Address.user_id`` column is equated to ``id``, which in"
" the context of the ``User`` class is the :class:`.Column` named ``id`` "
"(note that ``id`` is also the name of a Python built in function, which "
"is not what we want to use here - if we were outside of the ``User`` "
"class definition, we'd use ``User.id``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapped_sql_expr.rst:143
msgid ""
"The :meth:`.select.correlate_except` directive indicates that each "
"element in the FROM clause of this :func:`.select` may be omitted from "
"the FROM list (that is, correlated to the enclosing SELECT statement "
"against ``User``) except for the one corresponding to ``Address``.  This "
"isn't strictly necessary, but prevents ``Address`` from being "
"inadvertently omitted from the FROM list in the case of a long string of "
"joins between ``User`` and ``Address`` tables where SELECT statements "
"against ``Address`` are nested."

"If import issues prevent the :func:`.column_property` from being defined "

"In cases where a SQL query more elaborate than what "
":func:`.orm.column_property` or :class:`.hybrid_property` can provide "
"must be emitted, a regular Python function accessed as an attribute can "
"be used, assuming the expression only needs to be available on an "
"already-loaded instance.   The function is decorated with Python's own "
"``@property`` decorator to mark it as a read-only attribute.   Within the"
" function, :func:`.object_session` is used to locate the "
":class:`.Session` corresponding to the current object, which is then used"
" to emit a query::"

"The plain descriptor approach is useful as a last resort, but is less "
