"A typical example of a \"mutable\" structure is a Python dictionary. "
"Following the example introduced in :ref:`types_toplevel`, we begin with "
"a custom type that marshals Python dictionaries into JSON strings before "
"being persisted::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:36
msgid ""
"The usage of ``json`` is only for the purposes of example. The "
":mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.mutable` extension can be used with any type whose "
"target Python type may be mutable, including :class:`.PickleType`, "
":class:`.postgresql.ARRAY`, etc."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:41
msgid ""
"When using the :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.mutable` extension, the value itself "
"tracks all parents which reference it.  Below, we illustrate a simple "
"version of the :class:`.MutableDict` dictionary object, which applies the"
" :class:`.Mutable` mixin to a plain Python dictionary::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:74
msgid ""
"The above dictionary class takes the approach of subclassing the Python "
"built-in ``dict`` to produce a dict subclass which routes all mutation "
"events through ``__setitem__``.  There are variants on this approach, "
"such as subclassing ``UserDict.UserDict`` or "
"``collections.MutableMapping``; the part that's important to this example"
" is that the :meth:`.Mutable.changed` method is called whenever an in-"
"place change to the datastructure takes place."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:82
msgid ""
"We also redefine the :meth:`.Mutable.coerce` method which will be used to"
" convert any values that are not instances of ``MutableDict``, such as "
"the plain dictionaries returned by the ``json`` module, into the "
"appropriate type.  Defining this method is optional; we could just as "
"well created our ``JSONEncodedDict`` such that it always returns an "
"instance of ``MutableDict``, and additionally ensured that all calling "
"code uses ``MutableDict`` explicitly.  When :meth:`.Mutable.coerce` is "
"not overridden, any values applied to a parent object which are not "
"instances of the mutable type will raise a ``ValueError``."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:92
msgid ""
"Our new ``MutableDict`` type offers a class method "
":meth:`~.Mutable.as_mutable` which we can use within column metadata to "
"associate with types. This method grabs the given type object or class "
"and associates a listener that will detect all future mappings of this "
"type, applying event listening instrumentation to the mapped attribute. "
"Such as, with classical table metadata::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:106
msgid ""
"Above, :meth:`~.Mutable.as_mutable` returns an instance of "
"``JSONEncodedDict`` (if the type object was not an instance already), "
"which will intercept any attributes which are mapped against this type.  "
"Below we establish a simple mapping against the ``my_data`` table::"

"The ``MutableDict`` can be associated with all future instances of "
"``JSONEncodedDict`` in one step, using :meth:`~.Mutable.associate_with`."

msgid "Supporting Pickling"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:165
msgid ""
"The key to the :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.mutable` extension relies upon the "
"placement of a ``weakref.WeakKeyDictionary`` upon the value object, which"
" stores a mapping of parent mapped objects keyed to the attribute name "
"under which they are associated with this value. ``WeakKeyDictionary`` "
"objects are not picklable, due to the fact that they contain weakrefs and"
" function callbacks. In our case, this is a good thing, since if this "
"dictionary were picklable, it could lead to an excessively large pickle "
"size for our value objects that are pickled by themselves outside of the "
"context of the parent. The developer responsibility here is only to "
"provide a ``__getstate__`` method that excludes the "
":meth:`~MutableBase._parents` collection from the pickle stream::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:183
msgid ""
"With our dictionary example, we need to return the contents of the dict "
"itself (and also restore them on __setstate__)::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:195
msgid ""
"In the case that our mutable value object is pickled as it is attached to"
" one or more parent objects that are also part of the pickle, the "

msgid "Establishing Mutability on Composites"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:227
msgid ""
"Composites are a special ORM feature which allow a single scalar "
"attribute to be assigned an object value which represents information "
"\"composed\" from one or more columns from the underlying mapped table. "
"The usual example is that of a geometric \"point\", and is introduced in "
":ref:`mapper_composite`."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:232
msgid ""
"The internals of :func:`.orm.composite` have been greatly simplified and "
"in-place mutation detection is no longer enabled by default; instead, the"
" user-defined value must detect changes on its own and propagate them to "
"all owning parents. The :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.mutable` extension provides "
"the helper class :class:`.MutableComposite`, which is a slight variant on"
" the :class:`.Mutable` class."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:240
msgid ""
"As is the case with :class:`.Mutable`, the user-defined composite class "
"subclasses :class:`.MutableComposite` as a mixin, and detects and "
"delivers change events to its parents via the "
":meth:`.MutableComposite.changed` method. In the case of a composite "
"class, the detection is usually via the usage of Python descriptors (i.e."
" ``@property``), or alternatively via the special Python method "
"``__setattr__()``. Below we expand upon the ``Point`` class introduced in"
" :ref:`mapper_composite` to subclass :class:`.MutableComposite` and to "
"also route attribute set events via ``__setattr__`` to the "
":meth:`.MutableComposite.changed` method::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.mutable:277
msgid ""
"The :class:`.MutableComposite` class uses a Python metaclass to "
"automatically establish listeners for any usage of :func:`.orm.composite`"
" that specifies our ``Point`` type. Below, when ``Point`` is mapped to "
"the ``Vertex`` class, listeners are established which will route change "
"events from ``Point`` objects to each of the ``Vertex.start`` and "
"``Vertex.end`` attributes::"

"to pickle instances of ``Point`` or its owning class ``Vertex``, we at "
"least need to define a ``__getstate__`` that doesn't include the "
