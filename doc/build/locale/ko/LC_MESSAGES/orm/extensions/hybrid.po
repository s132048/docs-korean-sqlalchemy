"Consider a mapping ``Interval``, representing integer ``start`` and "
"``end`` values. We can define higher level functions on mapped classes "
"that produce SQL expressions at the class level, and Python expression "
"evaluation at the instance level.  Below, each function decorated with "
":class:`.hybrid_method` or :class:`.hybrid_property` may receive ``self``"
" as an instance of the class, or as the class itself::"

"Above, the ``length`` property returns the difference between the ``end``"
" and ``start`` attributes.  With an instance of ``Interval``, this "
"subtraction occurs in Python, using normal Python descriptor mechanics::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid:57
msgid ""
"When dealing with the ``Interval`` class itself, the "
":class:`.hybrid_property` descriptor evaluates the function body given "
"the ``Interval`` class as the argument, which when evaluated with "
"SQLAlchemy expression mechanics returns a new SQL expression::"

"ORM methods such as :meth:`~.Query.filter_by` generally use ``getattr()``"

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid:80
msgid ""
"The ``Interval`` class example also illustrates two methods, "
"``contains()`` and ``intersects()``, decorated with "
":class:`.hybrid_method`. This decorator applies the same idea to methods "
"that :class:`.hybrid_property` applies to attributes.   The methods "
"return boolean values, and take advantage of the Python ``|`` and ``&`` "
"bitwise operators to produce equivalent instance-level and SQL "

"Our usage of the ``&`` and ``|`` bitwise operators above was fortunate, "
"considering our functions operated on two boolean values to return a new "
"one.   In many cases, the construction of an in-Python function and a "
"SQLAlchemy SQL expression have enough differences that two separate "
"Python expressions should be defined.  The :mod:`~sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid` "
"decorators define the :meth:`.hybrid_property.expression` modifier for "
"this purpose.   As an example we'll define the radius of the interval, "
"which requires the usage of the absolute value function::"

"When defining an expression for a hybrid property or method, the "

msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid:212
msgid ""
"Normally, when using a hybrid with :meth:`.Query.update`, the SQL "

"A more comprehensive form of the custom comparator is to construct a "
"*Hybrid Value Object*. This technique applies the target value or "
