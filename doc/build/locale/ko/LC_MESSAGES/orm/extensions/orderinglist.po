"``orderinglist`` is a helper for mutable ordered relationships.  It will "
"intercept list operations performed on a :func:`.relationship`-managed "
"collection and automatically synchronize changes in list position onto a "
"target scalar attribute."

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.orderinglist:12
msgid ""
"Example: A ``slide`` table, where each row refers to zero or more entries"
" in a related ``bullet`` table.   The bullets within a slide are "
"displayed in order based on the value of the ``position`` column in the "
"``bullet`` table.   As entries are reordered in memory, the value of the "
"``position`` attribute should be updated to reflect the new sort order::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.orderinglist:36
msgid ""
"The standard relationship mapping will produce a list-like attribute on "
"each ``Slide`` containing all related ``Bullet`` objects, but coping with"
" changes in ordering is not handled automatically. When appending a "
"``Bullet`` into ``Slide.bullets``, the ``Bullet.position`` attribute will"
" remain unset until manually assigned.   When the ``Bullet`` is inserted "
"into the middle of the list, the following ``Bullet`` objects will also "
"need to be renumbered."

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.orderinglist:44
msgid ""
"The :class:`.OrderingList` object automates this task, managing the "
"``position`` attribute on all ``Bullet`` objects in the collection.  It "
"is constructed using the :func:`.ordering_list` factory::"

"The :class:`.OrderingList` construct only works with **changes** to a "
"collection, and not the initial load from the database, and requires that"
" the list be sorted when loaded.  Therefore, be sure to specify "
"``order_by`` on the :func:`.relationship` against the target ordering "
"attribute, so that the ordering is correct when first loaded."

":class:`.OrderingList` only provides limited functionality when a primary"
" key column or unique column is the target of the sort.  Operations that "
"are unsupported or are problematic include:"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.orderinglist:91
msgid ""
"two entries must trade values.  This is not supported directly in the "
"case of a primary key or unique constraint because it means at least one "
"row would need to be temporarily removed first, or changed to a third, "
"neutral value while the switch occurs."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.orderinglist:96
msgid ""
"an entry must be deleted in order to make room for a new entry. "
"SQLAlchemy's unit of work performs all INSERTs before DELETEs within a "
"single flush.  In the case of a primary key, it will trade an "
"INSERT/DELETE of the same primary key for an UPDATE statement in order to"
" lessen the impact of this limitation, however this does not take place "
"for a UNIQUE column. A future feature will allow the \"DELETE before "
"INSERT\" behavior to be possible, allevating this limitation, though this"
" feature will require explicit configuration at the mapper level for sets"
" of columns that are to be handled in this way."

":func:`.ordering_list` takes the name of the related object's ordering "
"attribute as an argument.  By default, the zero-based integer index of "
"the object's position in the :func:`.ordering_list` is synchronized with "
"the ordering attribute: index 0 will get position 0, index 1 position 1, "
"etc.  To start numbering at 1 or some other integer, provide "
"``count_from=1``."
