"The :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.instrumentation` package provides for alternate "
"systems of class instrumentation within the ORM.  Class instrumentation "
"refers to how the ORM places attributes on the class which maintain data "

"class."

"The :mod:`sqlalchemy.orm.instrumentation` was split out so that all "

"takes effect, including recognition of ``__sa_instrumentation_manager__``"
" on mapped classes, as well :data:`.instrumentation_finders` being used "
