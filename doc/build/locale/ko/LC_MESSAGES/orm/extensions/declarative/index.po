"The Declarative system is the typically used system provided by the "
"SQLAlchemy ORM in order to define classes mapped to relational database "
"tables.  However, as noted in :ref:`classical_mapping`, Declarative is in"
" fact a series of extensions that ride on top of the SQLAlchemy "
":func:`.mapper` construct."

"While the documentation typically refers to Declarative for most "
"examples, the following sections will provide detailed information on how"
" the Declarative API interacts with the basic :func:`.mapper` and Core "
":class:`.Table` systems, as well as how sophisticated patterns can be "
"built using systems such as mixins."
