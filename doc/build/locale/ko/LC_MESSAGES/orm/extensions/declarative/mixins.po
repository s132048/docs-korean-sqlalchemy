"A common need when using :mod:`~sqlalchemy.ext.declarative` is to share "
"some functionality, such as a set of common columns, some common table "
"options, or other mapped properties, across many classes.  The standard "
"Python idioms for this is to have the classes inherit from a base which "
"includes these common features."

"When using :mod:`~sqlalchemy.ext.declarative`, this idiom is allowed via "
"the usage of a custom declarative base class, as well as a \"mixin\" "

"of how mappings are declared.   An example of some commonly mixed-in "
"idioms is below::"
