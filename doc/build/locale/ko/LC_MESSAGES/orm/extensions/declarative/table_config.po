"Table arguments other than the name, metadata, and mapped Column "
"arguments are specified using the ``__table_args__`` class attribute. "
"This attribute accommodates both positional as well as keyword arguments "
"that are normally sent to the :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` "
"constructor. The attribute can be specified in one of two forms. One is "
"as a dictionary::"

"As an alternative to ``__tablename__``, a direct "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` construct may be used.  The "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Column` objects, which in this case require "
"their names, will be added to the mapping just like a regular mapping to "
"a table::"

"``__table__`` provides a more focused point of control for establishing "
"table metadata, while still getting most of the benefits of using "
"declarative. An application that uses reflection might want to load table"
" metadata elsewhere and pass it to declarative classes::"

"Some configuration schemes may find it more appropriate to use "
"``__table__``, such as those which already take advantage of the data-"
"driven nature of :class:`.Table` to customize and/or automate schema "

"Note that when the ``__table__`` approach is used, the object is "
"immediately usable as a plain :class:`.Table` within the class "
"declaration body itself, as a Python class is only another syntactical "
"block.  Below this is illustrated by using the ``id`` column in the "
"``primaryjoin`` condition of a :func:`.relationship`::"

"Similarly, mapped attributes which refer to ``__table__`` can be placed "

"However, one improvement that can be made here is to not require the "
":class:`.Engine` to be available when classes are being first declared."
"   To achieve this, use the :class:`.DeferredReflection` mixin, which "
"sets up mappings only after a special ``prepare(engine)`` step is "
