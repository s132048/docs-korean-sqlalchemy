"interacts with SQLAlchemy ORM relationship constructs.  For general "
"information about setting up relationships between mappings, see "

"Relationships to other classes are done in the usual way, with the added "
"feature that the class specified to :func:`~sqlalchemy.orm.relationship` "
"may be a string name.  The \"class registry\" associated with ``Base`` is"
" used at mapper compilation time to resolve the name into the actual "
"class object, which is expected to have been defined once the mapper "
"configuration is used::"

"Column constructs, since they are just that, are immediately usable, as "
"below where we define a primary join condition on the ``Address`` class "
"using them::"

"In addition to the main argument for "
":func:`~sqlalchemy.orm.relationship`, other arguments which depend upon "
"the columns present on an as-yet undefined class may also be specified as"
" strings.  These strings are evaluated as Python expressions.  The full "
"namespace available within this evaluation includes all classes mapped "
"for this declarative base, as well as the contents of the ``sqlalchemy`` "
"package, including expression functions like "
":func:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.desc` and "
":attr:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.func`::"

"For the case where more than one module contains a class of the same "
"name, string class names can also be specified as module-qualified paths "
"within any of these string expressions::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/declarative/relationships.rst:73
msgid ""
"The qualified path can be any partial path that removes ambiguity between"
" the names.  For example, to disambiguate between "
"``myapp.model.address.Address`` and ``myapp.model.lookup.Address``, we "
"can specify ``address.Address`` or ``lookup.Address``::"

"Many-to-many relationships are also declared in the same way with "
"declarative as with traditional mappings. The ``secondary`` argument to "
":func:`.relationship` is as usual passed a :class:`.Table` object, which "

"usually shares the :class:`.MetaData` object used by the declarative "
"base::"

#: ../../orm/extensions/declarative/relationships.rst:131
msgid ""
"Like other :func:`~sqlalchemy.orm.relationship` arguments, a string is "
"accepted as well, passing the string name of the table as defined in the "
"``Base.metadata.tables`` collection::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/extensions/declarative/relationships.rst:140
msgid ""
"As with traditional mapping, its generally not a good idea to use a "
":class:`.Table` as the \"secondary\" argument which is also mapped to a "
"class, unless the :func:`.relationship` is declared with "
"``viewonly=True``. Otherwise, the unit-of-work system may attempt "
"duplicate INSERT and DELETE statements against the underlying table."
