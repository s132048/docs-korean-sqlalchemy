"This feature allows particular columns of a table be loaded only upon "
"direct access, instead of when the entity is queried using "
":class:`.Query`.  This feature is useful when one wants to avoid loading "
"a large text or binary field into memory when it's not needed. Individual"
" columns can be lazy loaded by themselves or placed into groups that "
"lazy-load together, using the :func:`.orm.deferred` function to mark them"
" as \"deferred\". In the example below, we define a mapping that will "
"load each of ``.excerpt`` and ``.photo`` in separate, individual-row "
"SELECT statements when each attribute is first referenced on the "
"individual object instance::"

"Deferred columns can be associated with a \"group\" name, so that they "
