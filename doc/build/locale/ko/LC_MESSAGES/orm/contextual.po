"Recall from the section :ref:`session_faq_whentocreate`, the concept of "
"\"session scopes\" was introduced, with an emphasis on web applications "
"and the practice of linking the scope of a :class:`.Session` with that of"
" a web request.   Most modern web frameworks include integration tools so"
" that the scope of the :class:`.Session` can be managed automatically, "
"and these tools should be used as they are available."

"The :class:`.scoped_session` object is a very popular and useful object "

"A :class:`.scoped_session` is constructed by calling it, passing it a "

"The job of the :class:`.scoped_session` is simple; hold onto a "

"directly; when methods are called on this object, they are **proxied** to"
" the underlying :class:`.Session` being maintained by the registry::"

"Users who are familiar with multithreaded programming will note that "
"representing anything as a global variable is usually a bad idea, as it "
"implies that the global object will be accessed by many threads "
"concurrently.   The :class:`.Session` object is entirely designed to be "
"used in a **non-concurrent** fashion, which in terms of multithreading "
"means \"only in one thread at a time\".   So our above example of "
":class:`.scoped_session` usage, where the same :class:`.Session` object "
"is maintained across multiple calls, suggests that some process needs to "
"be in place such that multiple calls across many threads don't actually "
"get a handle to the same session.   We call this notion **thread local "
"storage**, which means, a special object is used that will maintain a "
"distinct object per each application thread.   Python provides this via "
"the `threading.local() "
"<http://docs.python.org/library/threading.html#threading.local>`_ "
"construct.  The :class:`.scoped_session` object by default uses this "
"object as storage, so that a single :class:`.Session` is maintained for "
"all who call upon the :class:`.scoped_session` registry, but only within "
"the scope of a single thread.   Callers who call upon the registry in a "
"different thread get a :class:`.Session` instance that is local to that "
"other thread."

"Using this technique, the :class:`.scoped_session` provides a quick and "
"relatively simple (if one is familiar with thread-local storage) way of "
"providing a single, global object in an application that is safe to be "

"The :meth:`.scoped_session.remove` method, as always, removes the current"
" :class:`.Session` associated with the thread, if any.  However, one "
"advantage of the ``threading.local()`` object is that if the application "
"thread itself ends, the \"storage\" for that thread is also garbage "
"collected.  So it is in fact \"safe\" to use thread local scope with an "
"application that spawns and tears down threads, without the need to call "
":meth:`.scoped_session.remove`.  However, the scope of transactions "
"themselves, i.e. ending them via :meth:`.Session.commit` or "
":meth:`.Session.rollback`, will usually still be something that must be "
"explicitly arranged for at the appropriate time, unless the application "
"actually ties the lifespan of a thread to the lifespan of a transaction."

"As discussed in the section :ref:`session_faq_whentocreate`, a web "
"application is architected around the concept of a **web request**, and "
"integrating such an application with the :class:`.Session` usually "
"implies that the :class:`.Session` will be associated with that request."
"  As it turns out, most Python web frameworks, with notable exceptions "
"such as the asynchronous frameworks Twisted and Tornado, use threads in a"
" simple way, such that a particular web request is received, processed, "
"and completed within the scope of a single *worker thread*.  When the "
"request ends, the worker thread is released to a pool of workers where it"
" is available to handle another request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/contextual.rst:158
msgid ""
"This simple correspondence of web request and thread means that to "
"associate a :class:`.Session` with a thread implies it is also associated"
" with the web request running within that thread, and vice versa, "
"provided that the :class:`.Session` is created only after the web request"
" begins and torn down just before the web request ends. So it is a common"
" practice to use :class:`.scoped_session` as a quick way to integrate the"
" :class:`.Session` with a web application.  The sequence diagram below "
"illustrates this flow::"

"Ensure that :meth:`.scoped_session.remove` is called when the web request"

"As noted earlier, the above pattern is **just one potential way** to "
"integrate a :class:`.Session` with a web framework, one which in "
"particular makes the significant assumption that the **web framework "
"associates web requests with application threads**.  It is however "
"**strongly recommended that the integration tools provided with the web "
"framework itself be used, if available**, instead of "
":class:`.scoped_session`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/contextual.rst:213

"In particular, while using a thread local can be convenient, it is "
"preferable that the :class:`.Session` be associated **directly with the "

" usage of :class:`.scoped_session` with direct request based scope, or "

"If the ``Request`` object is hashable, then this function can be easily "
