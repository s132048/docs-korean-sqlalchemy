"When classes are mapped in inheritance hierarchies using the \"joined\", "
"\"single\", or \"concrete\" table inheritance styles as described at "
":ref:`inheritance_toplevel`, the usual behavior is that a query for a "
"particular base class will also yield objects corresponding to subclasses"
" as well.   When a single query is capable of returning a result with a "
"different class or subclasses per result row, we use the term "
"\"polymorphic loading\"."

msgid ""
"Within the realm of polymorphic loading, specifically with joined and "
"single table inheritance, there is an additional problem of which "
"subclass attributes are to be queried up front, and which are to be "
"loaded later. When an attribute of a particular subclass is queried up "
"front, we can use it in our query as something to filter on, and it also "
"will be loaded when we get our objects back.   If it's not queried up "
"front, it gets loaded later when we first need to access it.   Basic "
"control of this behavior is provided using the "
":func:`.orm.with_polymorphic` function, as well as two variants, the "
"mapper configuration :paramref:`.mapper.with_polymorphic` in conjunction "
"with the :paramref:`.mapper.polymorphic_load` option, and the "
":class:`.Query` -level :meth:`.Query.with_polymorphic` method.    The "
"\"with_polymorphic\" family each provide a means of specifying which "
"specific subclasses of a particular base class should be included within "
"a query, which implies what columns and tables will be available in the "
"SELECT."
