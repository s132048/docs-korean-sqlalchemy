"In the most general sense, the :class:`~.Session` establishes all "
"conversations with the database and represents a \"holding zone\" for all"
" the objects which you've loaded or associated with it during its "
"lifespan. It provides the entrypoint to acquire a :class:`.Query` object,"
" which sends queries to the database using the :class:`~.Session` "
"object's current database connection, populating result rows into objects"
" that are then stored in the :class:`.Session`, inside a structure called"
" the `Identity Map "
"<http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html>`_ - a data "
"structure that maintains unique copies of each object, where \"unique\" "

":class:`.Session`, and to continue using them, though this practice has "
"its caveats.  It's intended that usually, you'd re-associate detached "

"A web application is the easiest case because such an application is "

"of linking the scope of the :class:`.Session` to that of the request.  "
"The :class:`.Session` can be established as the request begins, or using "
"a :term:`lazy initialization` pattern which establishes one as soon as it"

"application logic can access the current :class:`.Session` in a manner "
"associated with how the actual request object is accessed.  As the "
"request ends, the :class:`.Session` is torn down as well, usually through"
" the usage of event hooks provided by the web framework.   The "
"transaction used by the :class:`.Session` may also be committed at this "
"point, or alternatively the application may opt for an explicit commit "
"pattern, only committing for those requests where one is warranted, but "
"still always tearing down the :class:`.Session` unconditionally at the "
"end."
