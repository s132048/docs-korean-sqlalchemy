"As introduced in the sections :ref:`server_defaults` and "

"columns for which the database itself generates a value upon INSERT and "
"in less common cases upon UPDATE statements.  The ORM features support "
"for such columns regarding being able to fetch these newly generated "

"In the vast majority of cases, primary key columns that have their value "
"generated automatically by the database are  simple integer columns, "
"which are implemented by the database as either a so-called "
"\"autoincrement\" column, or from a sequence associated with the column."
"   Every database dialect within SQLAlchemy Core supports a method of "
"retrieving these primary key values which is often native to the Python "
"DBAPI, and in general this process is automatic, with the exception of a "
"database like Oracle that requires us to specify a :class:`.Sequence` "

"supported on all backends, however, so care must be taken to use the "
"appropriate method. The two questions to be answered are, 1. is this "
"column part of the primary key or not, and 2. does the database support "
"RETURNING or an equivalent, such as \"OUTPUT inserted\"; these are SQL "
