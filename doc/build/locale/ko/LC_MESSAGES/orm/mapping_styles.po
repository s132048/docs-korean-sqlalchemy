"Modern SQLAlchemy features two distinct styles of mapper configuration. "
"The \"Classical\" style is SQLAlchemy's original mapping API, whereas "
"\"Declarative\" is the richer and more succinct system that builds on top"
" of \"Classical\".   Both styles may be used interchangeably, as the end "
"result of each is exactly the same - a user-defined class mapped by the "
":func:`.mapper` function onto a selectable unit, typically a "
":class:`.Table`."

"The *Declarative Mapping* is the typical way that mappings are "
"constructed in modern SQLAlchemy. Making use of the "
":ref:`declarative_toplevel` system, the components of the user-defined "
"class as well as the :class:`.Table` metadata to which the class is "
"mapped are defined at once::"

"Above, a basic single-table mapping with four columns.   Additional "
"attributes, such as relationships to other mapped classes, are also "
"declared inline within the class definition::"
msgstr ""

"The declarative mapping system is introduced in the "
":ref:`ormtutorial_toplevel`.  For additional details on how this system "
"works, see :ref:`declarative_toplevel`."

#: ../../orm/mapping_styles.rst:65
msgid ""
"A *Classical Mapping* refers to the configuration of a mapped class using"
" the :func:`.mapper` function, without using the Declarative system.  "
"This is SQLAlchemy's original class mapping API, and is still the base "
"mapping system provided by the ORM."

"In \"classical\" form, the table metadata is created separately with the "
":class:`.Table` construct, then associated with the ``User`` class via "
"the :func:`.mapper` function::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapping_styles.rst:94
msgid ""
"Information about mapped attributes, such as relationships to other "
"classes, are provided via the ``properties`` dictionary.  The example "
"below illustrates a second :class:`.Table` object, mapped to a class "
"called ``Address``, then linked to ``User`` via :func:`.relationship`::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapping_styles.rst:110
msgid ""
"When using classical mappings, classes must be provided directly without "
"the benefit of the \"string lookup\" system provided by Declarative.  SQL"
" expressions are typically specified in terms of the :class:`.Table` "
"objects, i.e. ``address.c.id`` above for the ``Address`` relationship, "
"and not ``Address.id``, as ``Address`` may not yet be linked to table "
"metadata, nor can we specify a string here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../orm/mapping_styles.rst:116
msgid ""
"Some examples in the documentation still use the classical approach, but "
"note that the classical as well as Declarative approaches are **fully "
"interchangeable**.  Both systems ultimately create the same "
"configuration, consisting of a :class:`.Table`, user-defined class, "
"linked together with a :func:`.mapper`.  When we talk about \"the "
"behavior of :func:`.mapper`\", this includes when using the Declarative "
"system as well - it's still used, just behind the scenes."
