"The reason for the hard removal of ``.c.`` is that in 0.5, class-bound "
"descriptors carry potentially different meaning, as well as information "
"regarding class mappings, versus plain ``Column`` objects - and there are"
" use cases where you'd specifically want to use one or the other. "
"Generally, using class-bound descriptors invokes a set of "
"mapping/polymorphic aware translations, and using table- bound columns "
"does not.  In 0.4, these translations were applied across the board to "
"all expressions, but 0.5 differentiates completely between columns and "
"mapped descriptors, only applying translations to the latter.  So in many"
" cases, particularly when dealing with joined table inheritance "
"configurations as well as when using ``query(<columns>)``, "
"``Class.propname`` and ``table.c.colname`` are not interchangeable."

"For example, ``session.query(users.c.id, users.c.name)`` is different "
"versus ``session.query(User.id, User.name)``; in the latter case, the "
"``Query`` is aware of the mapper in use and further mapper-specific "
"operations like ``query.join(<propname>)``, ``query.with_parent()`` etc. "
"may be used, but in the former case cannot.  Additionally, in polymorphic"
" inheritance scenarios, the class-bound descriptors refer to the columns "
"present in the polymorphic selectable in use, not necessarily the table "
"column which directly corresponds to the descriptor.  For example, a set "
"of classes related by joined-table inheritance to the ``person`` table "
"along the ``person_id`` column of each table will all have their "
"``Class.person_id`` attribute mapped to the ``person_id`` column in "
"``person``, and not their subclass table. Version 0.4 would map this "
"behavior onto table-bound ``Column`` objects automatically.  In 0.5, this"
" automatic conversion has been removed, so that you in fact *can* use "
"table-bound columns as a means to override the translations which occur "
"with polymorphic querying; this allows ``Query`` to be able to create "
"optimized selects among joined-table or concrete-table inheritance "
"setups, as well as portable subqueries, etc."

"\"oid\" column of the primary mapped table, and all lazy/eagerly loaded "
