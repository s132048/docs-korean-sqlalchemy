"The :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.baked` extension, first introduced in the 1.0 "

"object, which is an object that generates a :class:`.Query` object in "
"conjunction with a cache key representing the structure of the query; "
"this cache key is then linked to the resulting string SQL statement so "
"that subsequent use of another :class:`.BakedQuery` with the same "
"structure will bypass all the overhead of building the :class:`.Query` "
"object, building the core :func:`.select` object within, as well as the "
"compilation of the :func:`.select` into a string, cutting out well the "
"majority of function call overhead normally associated with constructing "
"and emitting an ORM :class:`.Query` object."

"The :class:`.BakedQuery` is now used by default by the ORM when it "

"construct, e.g. that of the default ``lazy=\"select\"`` relationship "
"loader strategy.  This will allow for a significant reduction in function"
" calls within the scope of an application's use of lazy load queries to "
"load collections and related objects.   Previously, this feature was "
"available in 1.0 and 1.1 through the use of a global API method or by "
"using the ``baked_select`` strategy, it's now the only implementation for"

"value of cursor.arraysize which causes a new batch of rows to be read), "

"after subsequent fetch\". SQLAlchemy worked around this by both "
"automatically calling ``.read()`` upon these LOBs within its typing "
"system, as well as using a special ``BufferedColumnResultSet`` which "
