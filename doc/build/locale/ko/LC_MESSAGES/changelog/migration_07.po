msgid ""
"SQLAlchemy started early with the ``MapperExtension`` class, which "
"provided hooks into the persistence cycle of mappers. As SQLAlchemy "
"quickly became more componentized, pushing mappers into a more focused "
"configurational role, many more \"extension\", \"listener\", and "
"\"proxy\" classes popped up to solve various activity-interception use "
"cases in an ad-hoc fashion.   Part of this was driven by the divergence "
"of activities; ``ConnectionProxy`` objects wanted to provide a system of "
"rewriting statements and parameters; ``AttributeExtension`` provided a "
"system of replacing incoming values, and ``DDL`` objects had events that "
"could be switched off of dialect-sensitive callables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../changelog/migration_07.rst:73
msgid ""
"0.7 re-implements virtually all of these plugin points with a new, "
"unified approach, which retains all the functionalities of the different "
"systems, provides more flexibility and less boilerplate, performs better,"
" and eliminates the need to learn radically different APIs for each event"
" subsystem.  The pre-existing classes ``MapperExtension``, "
"``SessionExtension``, ``AttributeExtension``, ``ConnectionProxy``, "
"``PoolListener`` as well as the ``DDLElement.execute_at`` method are "
"deprecated and now implemented in terms of the new system - these APIs "
"remain fully functional and are expected to remain in place for the "
"foreseeable future."
msgstr ""

#: ../../changelog/migration_07.rst:86
msgid ""
"The new approach uses named events and user-defined callables to "
"associate activities with events. The API's look and feel was driven by "
"such diverse sources as JQuery, Blinker, and Hibernate, and was also "
"modified further on several occasions during conferences with dozens of "
"users on Twitter, which appears to have a much higher response rate than "
"the mailing list for such questions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../changelog/migration_07.rst:94
msgid ""
"It also features an open-ended system of target specification that allows"
" events to be associated with API classes, such as for all ``Session`` or"
" ``Engine`` objects, with specific instances of API classes, such as for "
"a specific ``Pool`` or ``Mapper``, as well as for related objects like a "
"user- defined class that's mapped, or something as specific as a certain "
"attribute on instances of a particular subclass of a mapped parent class."
" Individual listener subsystems can apply wrappers to incoming user- "
"defined listener functions which modify how they are called - an mapper "
"event can receive either the instance of the object being operated upon, "
"or its underlying ``InstanceState`` object. An attribute event can opt "
"whether or not to have the responsibility of returning a new value."

"Several systems now build upon the new event API, including the new "

"The \"derived attributes\" example has now been turned into an official "
