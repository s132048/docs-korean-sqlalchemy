"This is a late add to the 0.8 series, however it is hoped that the new "
"behavior is generally more consistent and intuitive in a wider variety of"
" situations.   The ORM has since at least version 0.4 included behavior "
"such that an object that's \"pending\", meaning that it's associated with"
" a :class:`.Session` but hasn't been inserted into the database yet, is "
"automatically expunged from the :class:`.Session` when it becomes an "
"\"orphan\", which means it has been de-associated with a parent object "
"that refers to it with ``delete-orphan`` cascade on the configured "
":func:`.relationship`.   This behavior is intended to approximately "
"mirror the behavior of a persistent (that is, already inserted) object, "
"where the ORM will emit a DELETE for such objects that become orphans "
"based on the interception of detachment events."
msgstr ""

#: ../../changelog/migration_08.rst:1011

"The behavioral change comes into play for objects that are referred to by"
" multiple kinds of parents that each specify ``delete-orphan``; the "
"typical example is an :ref:`association object <association_pattern>` "
"that bridges two other kinds of objects in a many-to-many pattern.   "
"Previously, the behavior was such that the pending object would be "
"expunged only when de-associated with *all* of its parents. With the "
"behavioral change, the pending object is expunged as soon as it is de-"
"associated from *any* of the parents that it was previously associated "
"with.  This behavior is intended to more closely match that of persistent"
" objects, which are deleted as soon as they are de-associated from any "
"parent."

"The rationale for the older behavior dates back at least to version 0.4, "

"associated with a :class:`.Session` via a subsequent attachment event but"
" still not fully associated.   In this situation, it is expected that the"
" database would emit an integrity error, as there are likely NOT NULL "
"foreign key columns that are unpopulated.   The ORM makes the decision to"
" let these INSERT attempts occur, based on the judgment that an object "
"that is only partially associated with its required parents but has been "
"actively associated with some of them, is more often than not a user "
"error, rather than an intentional omission which should be silently "
