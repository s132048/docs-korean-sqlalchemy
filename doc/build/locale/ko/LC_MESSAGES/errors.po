"SQLAlchemy errors can roughly be separated into two categories, the "
"**programming-time error** and the **runtime error**.     Programming-"
"time errors are raised as a result of functions or methods being called "
"with incorrect arguments, or from other configuration-oriented methods "
"such  as mapper configurations that can't be resolved.   The programming-"
"time error is typically immediate and deterministic.    The runtime error"
" on the other hand represents a failure that occurs as a program runs in "
"response to some condition that occurs arbitrarily, such as database "
"connections being exhausted or some data-related issue occurring.   "
"Runtime errors are more likely to be seen in the logs of a running "
"application as the program encounters these states in response to load "
"and data being encountered."

msgid ""
"**The SQLAlchemy Engine object uses a pool of connections by default** - "
"What this means is that when one makes use of a SQL database connection "
"resource of an :class:`.Engine` object, and then :term:`releases` that "
"resource, the database connection itself remains connected to the "
"database and is returned to an internal queue where it can be used again."
"  Even though the code may appear to be ending its conversation with the "
"database, in many cases the application will still maintain a fixed "
"number of database connections that persist until the application ends or"
" the pool is explicitly disposed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:61
msgid ""
"Because of the pool, when an application makes use of a SQL database "
"connection, most typically from either making use of "
":meth:`.Engine.connect` or when making queries using an ORM "
":class:`.Session`, this activity does not necessarily establish a new "
"connection to the database at the moment the connection object is "
"acquired; it instead consults the connection pool for a connection, which"
" will often retrieve an existing connection from the pool to be re-used."
"  If no connections are available, the pool will create a new database "
"connection, but only if the pool has not surpassed a configured capacity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:71
msgid ""
"The default pool used in most cases is called :class:`.QueuePool`.  When "
"you ask this pool to give you a connection and none are available, it "
"will create a new connection **if the total number of connections in play"
" are less than a configured value**.  This value is equal to the **pool "
"size plus the max overflow**.     That means if you have configured your "
"engine as::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:80
msgid ""
"The above :class:`.Engine` will allow **at most 30 connections** to be in"
" play at any time, not including connections that were detached from the "
"engine or invalidated.  If a request for a new connection arrives and 30 "
"connections are already in use by other parts of the application, the "
"connection pool will block for a fixed period of time, before timing out "
"and raising this error message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:87
msgid ""
"In order to allow for a higher number of connections be in use at once, "
"the pool can be adjusted using the :paramref:`.create_engine.pool_size` "
"and :paramref:`.create_engine.max_overflow` parameters as passed to the "
":func:`.create_engine` function.      The timeout to wait for a "
"connection to be available is configured using the "
":paramref:`.create_engine.pool_timeout` parameter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:94
msgid ""
"The pool can be configured to have unlimited overflow by setting "
":paramref:`.create_engine.max_overflow` to the value \"-1\".  With this "
"setting, the pool will still maintain a fixed pool of connections, "
"however it will never block upon a new connection being requested; it "
"will instead unconditionally make a new connection if none are available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:100
msgid ""
"However, when running in this way, if the application has an issue where "
"it is using up all available connectivity resources, it will eventually "
"hit the configured limit of available connections on the database itself,"
" which will again return an error.  More seriously, when the application "
"exhausts the database of connections, it usually will have caused a great"
" amount of  resources to be used up before failing, and can also "
"interfere with other applications and database status mechanisms that "
"rely upon being able to connect to the database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:109
msgid ""
"Given the above, the connection pool can be looked at as a **safety valve"
" for connection use**, providing a critical layer of protection against a"
" rogue application causing the entire database to become unavailable to "
"all other applications.   When receiving this error message, it is vastly"
" preferable to repair the issue using up too many connections and/or "
"configure the limits appropriately, rather than allowing for unlimited "
"overflow which does not actually solve the underlying issue."

msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:119
msgid ""
"**The application is fielding too many concurrent requests to do work "
"based on the configured value for the pool** - This is the most "
"straightforward cause.  If you have an application that runs in a thread "
"pool that allows for 30 concurrent threads, with one connection in use "
"per thread, if your pool is not configured to allow at least 30 "
"connections checked out at once, you will get this error once your "
"application receives enough concurrent requests. Solution is to raise the"
" limits on the pool or lower the number of concurrent threads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:128
msgid ""
"**The application is not returning connections to the pool** - This is "
"the next most common reason, which is that the application is making use "
"of the connection pool, but the program is failing to :term:`release` "
"these connections and is instead leaving them open.   The connection pool"
" as well as the ORM :class:`.Session` do have logic such that when the "
"session and/or connection object is garbage collected, it results in the "
"underlying connection resources being released, however this behavior "
"cannot be relied upon to release resources in a timely manner."
msgstr ""

#: ../../errors.rst:137
msgid ""
"A common reason this can occur is that the application uses ORM sessions "
"and does not call :meth:`.Session.close` upon them one the work involving"
" that session is complete. Solution is to make sure ORM sessions if using"
" the ORM, or engine-bound :class:`.Connection` objects if using Core, are"
" explicitly closed at the end of the work being done, either via the "
"appropriate ``.close()`` method, or by using one of the available context"

"**The application is attempting to run long-running transactions** - A "
"database transaction is a very expensive resource, and should **never be "

"running job queue, or is holding a persistent connection open to a "
"browser, **don't keep a database transaction open for the whole time**.  "

"**The application is deadlocking** - Also a common cause of this error "

"and greenlets making use of database resources are simply waiting too "
"long to attend to them.  Neither implicit nor explicit async programming "
"frameworks are typically necessary or appropriate for the vast majority "
"of relational database operations; if an application must use an async "
