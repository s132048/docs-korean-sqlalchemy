"Firebird locks tables aggressively.  For this reason, a DROP TABLE may "
"hang until other transactions are released.  SQLAlchemy does its best to "
"release transactions as quickly as possible.  The most common cause of "
"hanging transactions is a non-fully consumed result set, i.e.::"

"Where above, the ``ResultProxy`` has not been fully consumed.  The "
"connection will be returned to the pool and the transactional state "
"rolled back once the Python garbage collector reclaims the objects which "
"hold onto the connection, which often occurs asynchronously. The above "
"use case can be alleviated by calling ``first()`` on the ``ResultProxy`` "
"which will fetch the first row and immediately close all remaining "
"cursor/connection resources."

"``enable_rowcount`` - True by default, setting this to False disables the"
" usage of \"cursor.rowcount\" with the Kinterbasdb dialect, which "
"SQLAlchemy ordinarily calls upon automatically after any UPDATE or DELETE"
" statement.   When disabled, SQLAlchemy's ResultProxy will return -1 for "
"result.rowcount.   The rationale here is that Kinterbasdb requires a "
"second round trip to the database when .rowcount is called -  since "
"SQLA's resultproxy automatically closes the cursor after a non-result-"
"returning statement, rowcount must be called, if at all, before the "
"result object is returned.   Additionally, cursor.rowcount may not return"
" correct results with older versions of Firebird, and setting this flag "
"to False will also cause the SQLAlchemy ORM to ignore its usage. The "
"behavior can also be controlled on a per-execution basis using the "
"``enable_rowcount`` option with :meth:`.Connection.execution_options`::"

"``retaining`` - False by default.   Setting this to True will pass the "

"``.rollback()`` methods of the DBAPI connection, which can improve "
"performance in some situations, but apparently with significant caveats. "
"Please read the fdb and/or kinterbasdb DBAPI documentation in order to "
"understand the implications of this flag."
