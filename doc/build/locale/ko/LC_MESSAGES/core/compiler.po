msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:107
msgid ""
"SQL and DDL constructs are each compiled using different base compilers -"
" ``SQLCompiler`` and ``DDLCompiler``.   A common need is to access the "
"compilation rules of SQL expressions from within a DDL expression. The "
"``DDLCompiler`` includes an accessor ``sql_compiler`` for this reason, "
"such as below where we generate a CHECK constraint that embeds a SQL "
"expression::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:121
msgid ""
"Above, we add an additional flag to the process step as called by "
":meth:`.SQLCompiler.process`, which is the ``literal_binds`` flag.  This "
"indicates that any SQL expression which refers to a "
":class:`.BindParameter` object or other \"literal\" object such as those "
"which refer to strings or integers should be rendered **in-place**, "
"rather than being referred to as a bound parameter;  when emitting DDL, "
"bound parameters are typically not supported."

msgid "Enabling Autocommit on a Construct"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:135
msgid ""
"Recall from the section :ref:`autocommit` that the :class:`.Engine`, when"
" asked to execute a construct in the absence of a user-defined "
"transaction, detects if the given construct represents DML or DDL, that "
"is, a data modification or data definition statement, which requires (or "
"may require, in the case of DDL) that the transaction generated by the "
"DBAPI be committed (recall that DBAPI always has a transaction going on "
"regardless of what SQLAlchemy does).   Checking for this is actually "
"accomplished by checking for the \"autocommit\" execution option on the "
"construct.    When building a construct like an INSERT derivation, a new "
"DDL type, or perhaps a stored procedure that alters data, the "
"\"autocommit\" option needs to be set in order for the statement to "
"function with \"connectionless\" execution (as described in "
":ref:`dbengine_implicit`)."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:148
msgid ""
"Currently a quick way to do this is to subclass :class:`.Executable`, "
"then add the \"autocommit\" flag to the ``_execution_options`` dictionary"
" (note this is a \"frozen\" dictionary which supplies a generative "
"``union()`` method)::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:158
msgid ""
"More succinctly, if the construct is truly similar to an INSERT, UPDATE, "
"or DELETE, :class:`.UpdateBase` can be used, which already is a subclass "
"of :class:`.Executable`, :class:`.ClauseElement` and includes the "
"``autocommit`` flag::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:172
msgid ""
"DDL elements that subclass :class:`.DDLElement` already have the "
"\"autocommit\" flag turned on."

msgid "Changing the default compilation of existing constructs"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:181
msgid ""
"The compiler extension applies just as well to the existing constructs.  "
"When overriding the compilation of a built in SQL construct, the "
"@compiles decorator is invoked upon the appropriate class (be sure to use"
" the class, i.e. ``Insert`` or ``Select``, instead of the creation "
"function such as ``insert()`` or ``select()``)."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:187
msgid ""
"Within the new compilation function, to get at the \"original\" "
"compilation routine, use the appropriate visit_XXX method - this because "
"compiler.process() will call upon the overriding routine and cause an "
"endless loop.   Such as, to add \"prefix\" to all insert statements::"

msgid "Subclassing Guidelines"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:224
msgid ""
"A big part of using the compiler extension is subclassing SQLAlchemy "
"expression constructs. To make this easier, the expression and schema "
"packages feature a set of \"bases\" intended for common tasks. A synopsis"
" is as follows:"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:229
msgid ""
":class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.ClauseElement` - This is the root "
"expression class. Any SQL expression can be derived from this base, and "
"is probably the best choice for longer constructs such as specialized "
"INSERT statements."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:234
msgid ""
":class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.ColumnElement` - The root of all "
"\"column-like\" elements. Anything that you'd place in the \"columns\" "
"clause of a SELECT statement (as well as order by and group by) can "
"derive from this - the object will automatically have Python "
"\"comparison\" behavior."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:239
msgid ""
":class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.ColumnElement` classes want to have a "
"``type`` member which is expression's return type.  This can be "
"established at the instance level in the constructor, or at the class "
"level if its generally constant::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:247
msgid ""
":class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.functions.FunctionElement` - This is a hybrid of "
"a ``ColumnElement`` and a \"from clause\" like object, and represents a "
"SQL function or stored procedure type of call. Since most databases "
"support statements along the line of \"SELECT FROM <some function>\" "
"``FunctionElement`` adds in the ability to be used in the FROM clause of "
"a ``select()`` construct::"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:269
msgid ""
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.DDLElement` - The root of all DDL expressions,"
" like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc. Compilation of ``DDLElement`` "
"subclasses is issued by a ``DDLCompiler`` instead of a ``SQLCompiler``. "
"``DDLElement`` also features ``Table`` and ``MetaData`` event hooks via "
"the ``execute_at()`` method, allowing the construct to be invoked during "
"CREATE TABLE and DROP TABLE sequences."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:276
msgid ""
":class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.expression.Executable` - This is a mixin which "
"should be used with any expression class that represents a \"standalone\""
" SQL statement that can be passed directly to an ``execute()`` method.  "
"It is already implicit within ``DDLElement`` and ``FunctionElement``."

#: of sqlalchemy.ext.compiler:287
msgid ""
"A function that works like \"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\" except applies the "
"appropriate conversions so that the time is in UTC time.   Timestamps are"
" best stored in relational databases as UTC, without time zones.   UTC so"
" that your database doesn't think time has gone backwards in the hour "
"when daylight savings ends, without timezones because timezones are like "
"character encodings - they're best applied only at the endpoints of an "
"application (i.e. convert to UTC upon user input, re-apply desired "
"timezone upon display)."
