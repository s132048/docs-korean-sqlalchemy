"Subscribing to an event occurs through a single API point, the "
":func:`.listen` function, or alternatively the :func:`.listens_for` "
"decorator.   These functions accept a target, a string identifier which "
"identifies the event to be intercepted, and a user-defined listening "
"function.  Additional positional and keyword arguments to these two "
"functions may be supported by specific types of events, which may specify"
" alternate interfaces for the given event function, or provide "
"instructions regarding secondary event targets based on the given target."

"The name of an event and the argument signature of a corresponding "
"listener function is derived from a class bound specification method, "
"which exists bound to a marker class that's described in the "
"documentation. For example, the documentation for "
":meth:`.PoolEvents.connect` indicates that the event name is "
"``\"connect\"`` and that a user-defined listener function should receive "
"two positional arguments::"

"There are some varieties of argument styles which can be accepted by "

"this function is documented as receiving ``dbapi_connection`` and "
"``connection_record`` arguments. We can opt to receive these arguments by"
" name, by establishing a listener function that accepts ``**keyword`` "

":func:`.listens_for`::"
