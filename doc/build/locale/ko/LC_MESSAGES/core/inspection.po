"The inspection module provides the :func:`.inspect` function, which "
"delivers runtime information about a wide variety of SQLAlchemy objects, "
"both within the Core as well as the ORM."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.inspection:6
msgid ""
"The :func:`.inspect` function is the entry point to SQLAlchemy's public "
"API for viewing the configuration and construction of in-memory objects."
"   Depending on the type of object passed to :func:`.inspect`, the return"
" value will either be a related object which provides a known interface, "
"or in many cases it will return the object itself."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.inspection:13

"The rationale for :func:`.inspect` is twofold.  One is that it replaces "
"the need to be aware of a large variety of \"information getting\" "
"functions in SQLAlchemy, such as :meth:`.Inspector.from_engine`, "
":func:`.orm.attributes.instance_state`, :func:`.orm.class_mapper`, and "
"others.    The other is that the return value of :func:`.inspect` is "
"guaranteed to obey a documented API, thus allowing third party tools "
"which build on top of SQLAlchemy configurations to be constructed in a "
"forwards-compatible way."

"The returned value in some cases may be the same object as the one given,"
" such as if a :class:`.Mapper` object is passed.   In other cases, it "
"will be an instance of the registered inspection type for the given "
"object, such as if an :class:`.engine.Engine` is passed, an "
":class:`.Inspector` object is returned."

"``object`` - an object given will be checked by the ORM for a mapping - "

"mapped attribute - passing a mapped attribute to :func:`.inspect`, such "

":class:`.QueryableAttribute` object, which is the :term:`descriptor` "
