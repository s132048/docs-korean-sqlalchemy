"In the preceding sections we've discussed a variety of schema constructs "
"including :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table`, "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.ForeignKeyConstraint`, "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.CheckConstraint`, and "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Sequence`. Throughout, we've relied upon the "
"``create()`` and :func:`~sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData.create_all` methods "
"of :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table` and "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.MetaData` in order to issue data definition "
"language (DDL) for all constructs. When issued, a pre-determined order of"
" operations is invoked, and DDL to create each table is created "
"unconditionally including all constraints and other objects associated "
"with it. For more complex scenarios where database-specific DDL is "
"required, SQLAlchemy offers two techniques which can be used to add any "
"DDL based on any condition, either accompanying the standard generation "
"of tables or by itself."
