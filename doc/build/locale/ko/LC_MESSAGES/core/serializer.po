"Any SQLAlchemy query structure, either based on sqlalchemy.sql.* or "

" which are referenced by the structure are not persisted in serialized "

"Table metadata that is to be loaded entirely from the serialized "

" typically one which was reflected from an existing database at some "
"previous point in time.  The serializer module is specifically for the "
"opposite case, where the Table metadata is already present in memory."
