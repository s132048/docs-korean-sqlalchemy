"system of describing and inspecting database schemas."

"The core of SQLAlchemy's query and object mapping operations are "
"supported by *database metadata*, which is comprised of Python objects "
"that describe tables and other schema-level objects. These objects are at"
" the core of three major types of operations - issuing CREATE and DROP "
"statements (known as *DDL*), constructing SQL queries, and expressing "
"information about structures that already exist within the database."

#: ../../core/schema.rst:19

"Database metadata can be expressed by explicitly naming the various "
"components and their properties, using constructs such as "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table`, :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Column`, "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.ForeignKey` and "
":class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Sequence`, all of which are imported from the "
"``sqlalchemy.schema`` package. It can also be generated by SQLAlchemy "
"using a process called *reflection*, which means you start with a single "
"object such as :class:`~sqlalchemy.schema.Table`, assign it a name, and "
"then instruct SQLAlchemy to load all the additional information related "
"to that name from a particular engine source."

"A key feature of SQLAlchemy's database metadata constructs is that they "
"are designed to be used in a *declarative* style which closely resembles "
"that of real DDL. They are therefore most intuitive to those who have "
"some background in creating real schema generation scripts."
