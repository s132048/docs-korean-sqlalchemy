#: of sqlalchemy.exc:1
msgid "Exceptions used with SQLAlchemy."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc:3
msgid ""
"The base exception class is :exc:`.SQLAlchemyError`.  Exceptions which "
"are raised as a result of DBAPI exceptions are all subclasses of "
":exc:`.DBAPIError`."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.AmbiguousForeignKeysError:1
msgid ""
"Raised when more than one foreign key matching can be located between two"
" selectables during a join."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError:1
msgid "Raised when an invalid or conflicting function argument is supplied."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError:3
msgid "This error generally corresponds to construction time state errors."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.CircularDependencyError:1

msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.CircularDependencyError:3
msgid "There are two scenarios where this error occurs:"
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.CircularDependencyError:5
msgid ""
"In a Session flush operation, if two objects are mutually dependent on "
"each other, they can not be inserted or deleted via INSERT or DELETE "
"statements alone; an UPDATE will be needed to post-associate or pre-"
"deassociate one of the foreign key constrained values. The "
"``post_update`` flag described at :ref:`post_update` can resolve this "
"cycle."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.CircularDependencyError:11
msgid ""
"In a :attr:`.MetaData.sorted_tables` operation, two :class:`.ForeignKey` "
"or :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` objects mutually refer to each other.  "
"Apply the ``use_alter=True`` flag to one or both, see :ref:`use_alter`."

msgid "Raised when the execution of a database operation fails."
msgstr ""

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.DBAPIError:3
msgid ""
"Wraps exceptions raised by the DB-API underlying the database operation."
"  Driver-specific implementations of the standard DB-API exception types "
"are wrapped by matching sub-types of SQLAlchemy's :class:`DBAPIError` "
"when possible.  DB-API's ``Error`` type maps to :class:`DBAPIError` in "
"SQLAlchemy, otherwise the names are identical.  Note that there is no "
"guarantee that different DB-API implementations will raise the same "
"exception type for any given error condition."

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.DBAPIError:11
msgid ""
":class:`DBAPIError` features :attr:`~.StatementError.statement` and "

"when the error was raised within the context of emitting a SQL statement."

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.DisconnectionError:3
msgid ""
"This error is raised and consumed internally by a connection pool.  It "
"can be raised by the :meth:`.PoolEvents.checkout` event so that the host "
"pool forces a retry; the exception will be caught three times in a row "

":class:`~sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError` regarding the connection "

#: of sqlalchemy.exc.DontWrapMixin:1
msgid ""
"A mixin class which, when applied to a user-defined Exception class, will"
